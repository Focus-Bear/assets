## New Features

- Focus Music (Tools > Focus Music): we've added some curated music to get you in the zone while you're working/studying
- Note taking: you can now write notes during/after habits (good if you don't have an existing journaling app)
- Allow URLs/apps after focus block: at the end of a focus block, you can now save the URLs that you temporarily allowed in your focus mode settings.
- Offline improvements: app now works seamlessly while offline
- Fine grained password rules: e.g. allow postponing without a password during the morning routine but not in the evening
- Run breaks during habits: helpful if you have long habits (e.g. 90 minutes of deep work) where you are using your computer

## Bug Fixes
- Numerous stability fixes (e.g. problems with Focus Bear taking over one of the monitors inappropriately)
- Improvements to meeting detection
